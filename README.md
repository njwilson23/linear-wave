# Linear wave tank in JavaScript

The linear wave scripts are a set of demos drawn on an HTML5 `<canvas>` element.

**linwave.js** animates the linear surface gravity wave equations. Wave
parameters can be adjusted on the fly for the sake of exploration.

**internalwave.js** (unfinished) shows internal wave vectors and group velocities, and
demonstrates how wave properties change on reflection from a boundary.
